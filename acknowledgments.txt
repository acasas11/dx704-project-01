DX704 Week 1 — Acknowledgments
Date: 2025-09-07

People / Discussions
- None.  (Replace with names if you discussed the assignment with classmates, TAs, or others.)

External Libraries (beyond standard course stack)
- yfinance — used to download adjusted close prices and align to month-end trading days.
- scipy.optimize (SLSQP) — used to solve constrained mean–variance problems (GMV and target-return frontier).
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib — used for data wrangling, stats, and plotting. (Remove if these are already standard for the module.)

Data Sources
- Yahoo Finance (via yfinance) — historical adjusted close prices for AAPL, SPY, TSLA, COST, MSFT, NVDA.

Generative AI Usage
- Tool: ChatGPT (GPT-5 Thinking)
- Purpose: assistance on building notebook cells for data collection, returns/risk estimation,
  efficient frontier construction (GMV/target-return SLSQP), and resampling stability check.
- Actions taken: ChatGPT reviewed, tested, and helped edit my code; all outputs were validated on my data.

Other Sources
- None. (If you adapted code from example repos/videos or other references, briefly list them here.)

If none of the above acknowledgments apply, write: "none".
